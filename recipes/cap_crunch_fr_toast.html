<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  I am fond of this recipe. Like Bubba's Mom from allrecipes.com, I first had it when I ate at Blue Moon Cafe
  in Baltimore, Maryland. I went with a friend after Snowmageddon in 2010. Fun fact, I used it to convince my wife
  to have
  more kids too! I hope you enjoy the extra sweet crunch that regular french toast doesn't have.
